## ClugMSS (MineServer Alpha)
[Outdated]
This is a project I've been working on for the last month , which is supposed to be an alternative to the Bukkit platform , which was taken down for quite some time.

[Update]
I've just got back on working on this project , which I hope would be a real alternative to the current custom Minecraft server platforms.

#Download Instructions

Downloads can be found at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5pmlc05csbo7o3s/AACyDVuzdvWuzWNd6p44xXKpa?dl=0 which are made to any build since 17/01/15 by a homemade auto-compiler && auto commit maker.
After you've downloaded one of the builds , download MinecraftServer from the minecraft website , open the "toJar" folder in the zip , and copy it's contents to the MinecraftServer jar , and then you are done

#Installation
The server is like a normal server but you need to make 3 folders in the containing folder of the jar:
  
  1.plugins : for plugins
  
  2.data : for NBT data
  
  3.perms : for commands permissions
